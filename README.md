# Natural Language Processing Introduction

## Movie Genres Project

Use the 'Movie Metadata' dataset to predict the genres of the movies. The dataset contains the information of the movies, especially the summary/overview of the movie. A very general process of doing project on the text data is done here. It is still limited to the bag-of-word with reweightage. Some statistical methods are applied and I would come back for better methods later.
